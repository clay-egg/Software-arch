## Decision
What is the solution that we're proposing and/or doing?

We have decided to utilize Firebase as the backend solution for our web application development project. Firebase provides a comprehensive set of tools and services that will help us overcome the challenges we are facing:

Development Time and Resource Constraints: Firebase offers a set of pre-built backend services that are easy to integrate and require minimal development effort. This will help us reduce the development time and resources needed to build and manage a custom backend.

Lack of Specific Functionalities: Firebase provides a wide range of functionalities out-of-the-box, including user authentication, real-time updates, and static file hosting. By using Firebase, we can easily incorporate these features into our web application, enhancing its functionality and user experience.
## Rationale
